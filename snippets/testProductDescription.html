      <h2>Uses</h2>
      <p>
        Budesonide Compounded Capsules when given orally is typically used to
        treat inflammatory intestinal diseases, like chronic inflammatory
        enteropathies (or inflammatory bowel disease). As always, it is best to
        consult your veterinarian for proper diagnosis and uses.

    <div class="product-effects">
      <h2>Adverse Effects</h2>
      <p>
        Budesonide has been shown to cause HPA axis suppression in dogs when
        using the commercial formulation as well as compounded budesonide
        powder. Some studies have suggested that budesonide tends to cause less
        severe adverse effects as compared to prednisone, but findings have not
        been statistically significant. Budesonide is locally active in the FI
        tract, and as such, local adverse effects in the GI tract need to be
        considered.

    <div class="product-interactions">
      <h2>Drug &amp; Food Interactions</h2>
      <p>
        Aspirin: may cause increased risk of GI ulceration Non-Steroidal
        Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): may cause increased risk of GI
        ulceration Oral Antacids: It is best to separate budesonide from oral
        antacids by at least 2 hours due to pH dependency of the dissolution of
        the drug. Azole antifungals (fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole):
        concomitant use can increase the budesonide absorption and distribution
        through an hepatic enzyme inhibition.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="product-precautions">
      Budesonide is contraindicated in patients that are hypersensitive to it.
      Due to potential systemic corticosteroid effects, it should be used with
      caution in patients where glucocorticoid therapy is problematic. Reduced
      dosages may be required in those patients with impaired hepatic function.
      As always, please consult your veterinarian with any questions or concerns
      regarding any precautions, contraindications, or side effects.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <div class="faq-item-wrapper">
        <h4>What is compounding?</h4>
        <p>
          Compounding is a method of preparing individualized prescription
          medications by licensed pharmacists. Compounding allows the
          practitioner, the pharmacist, and the pet owner to collaborate to
          create custom dosages, flavors, and dosage forms for pets to easily,
          safely, and effectively take their medication. Often pet owners
          struggle to give oral tablets which is why ExpressVet offers
          compounded oral liquids, transdermal gels, capsules, and treats to
          make taking care of your pet easy.
