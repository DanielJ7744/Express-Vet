			<h2>Uses</h2>
			<p>
				Prednisolone is a corticosteroid that is used in dogs and cats to treat hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's disease),
				and other various conditions such as inflammation from arthritis, allergies and certain autoimmune diseases.
				Prednisolone reduces swelling and decreases a pet's ability to fight infections. It should be given with food to
				lessen stomach upset, and should not be stopped suddenly without talking to your veterinarian. There should be a
				gradual reduction in dosage before stopping as serious side effects may result.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="product-effects">
			<h2>Possible Side Effects</h2>
			<p>
				Prednisolone is safe for dogs, but like any medication, there are risks involved. Most common side effects of
				Prednisolone can include excessive thirst and excessive urination, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, upset stomach,
				and fatigue. They usually go away when the drug is stopped, but your veterinarian may start you off on a lower
				dose and slowly increase it to avoid these side effects. However, long-term use of high doses of Prednisolone
				may lead to serious health conditions, including stomach or intestinal ulcers, perforation, bleeding, diarrhea,
				lethargy, increased risk of infection, behavior changes, diabetes, or cushing’s disease. If your pet stops
				eating, or you notice signs such as high fever, black, tarry stools, or bloody vomit, contact your veterinarian
				immediately.

			<h2>Precautions</h2>
			<p>
				Pets that are allergic to Prednisolone should not take this medication. It is also not recommended for pets with
				viral infections, ulcers, tuberculosis, Cushing’s disease, or systemic fungal infections (unless it’s being used
				to treat Addison’s disease). Use the drug with caution for pets with diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis,
				cataracts, high blood pressure, or kidney disease. It should only be used in emergencies for younger animals and
				pregnant animals because it can stunt growth or cause ulcers.
				<br /><br />
				If you need to use Prednisone for your pet, always follow your vet’s instructions closely. Never abruptly stop
				the medication, but instead, slowly transition off of it.

		<div class="product-description">
			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>
				Prednisolone is given to your pet by mouth and with food. The best time to give your pet this medication is
				after meal to lessen stomach upset.<br />
				Prednisolone dosage depends on the dog's weight, so be sure to check with your vet. If the vet prescribes the
				medicine more than once daily, keep to the schedule. Never give two doses at a time, because prednisolone
				overdosing is linked with several severe side effects. <br />
				Most vets will only prescribe Prednisolone for a limited time. This is because short-term use of Prednisolone
				has fewer side effects than long-term use. The longer your dog is given Prednisolone, the higher the chances of
				developing adverse side effects.<br />
				Long-term prescriptions last about three to four months. In critical conditions, the treatment period may
				increase. Various factors play an essential role in deciding how long your dog stays on Prednisolone. Some
				long-term uses of Prednisolone will be prescribed for life.
			</p>
			<h4>Storage Instructions</h4>
			<p> Prednisolone Compounded Oral Liquid should be stored at a room temperature. </p>
			<h4>Doses</h4>
			<p>
				The dosage for Prednisolone depends on what condition your dog has, how much they weigh, and what type of
				Prednisolone you’re using.<br />
				For treatment of Addison’s disease, 0.05 to 0.18 mg per pound of body weight should be given to dogs until the
				condition is under control.<br />
				Once the condition is at a manageable level, your vet will likely decrease the dosage to an amount that will
				allow your dog to maintain healthy steroid levels. This can be as little as 0.009 mg per pound. Prednisone and
				prednisolone are usually given in these doses once daily by mouth.<br />
				An ideal dosage would be 0.5 milligrams per pound of body weight each day for anti-inflammatory effects. But if
				you need to suppress your dog’s immune system, it’s possible your vet will prescribe 1 milligram per pound,
				which is to be given throughout the day. The exact dosage will be prescribed by your veterinarian.
