        Gemfibrozil Compounded Oral Liquid is a medication to help treat
        hyperlipidemia in your pet. Hyperlipidemia are high levels of
        cholesterol or triglycerides in the blood and are common in dogs and
        cats. This condition can be brought on by obesity, diabetes,
        medication-induced, or genetically hereditary. To manage this condition
        and lower fats in the blood, your veterinarian may introduce a low fat,
        high-fiber diet along with lipid (fat) lowering medication such as
        gemfibrozil.
        <br />
        Gemfibrozil is a prescription drug that belongs to a group of
        medications known as fibrates which work by decreasing the amount of fat
        that the liver produces.
        <br />
        Generally, there are no obvious signs of hyperlipidemia, and your vet
        will often detect this condition with routine blood work. If clinical
        signs do appear they are often gastrointestinal related such as
        diarrhea, vomiting, pancreatitis, or even skin itching or hair loss.
        Treating high triglycerides is important to avoid worsting conditions
        such as seizures, pancreatitis, liver disease, or behavioral changes.
        Depending on the cause of this condition in your pet will determine how
        your veterinarian chooses to treat it.
